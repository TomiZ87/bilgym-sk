Tom made the plan for 180 mins. After that, he looked how we should do the second language website variation.

I continued with the translations for the Slovak version of the site and tried to come up with the different messages for the homepage slider.

Finding a suitable hosting for our Joomla website, so we can share it with the teacher. But to be honest, I haven't done much, I scrolled through the internet for hosting and then made documentation for this project. This is the most probable hosting we will use: https://www.awardspace.com/free-hosting/

By the end of February
I have finished the translation of the website pages into Slovak.
-Simon

Ok, I continued in finding a new hosting for our Joomla website, so I will proceed to transfer the page there after the maturita. + I looked at the 2 language system - but for only a few minutes.

3.3.2023
I was creating text for the slider on the homepage
-Šimon

We had a discussion with Simon about what we can add to the website, even more, improve its functions. For now, we decided we would add a plugin that will auto-translate new articles to Slovak or English: https://www.automatic-translation.online/installation; When the website is in both languages, we will try to implement this plugin. If it does not work, we will create a new one or find another. Otherwise, we were discussing a lot about the upcoming plans for the website but have not decided on anything else than it is now.

I studied enough and so I looked right inside the Joomla and tested the bilingual website on my testing website. I just managed to start it but did not actually add the add-on for translation. Just wanted to make sure some functions work. Otherwise, we started to work on the presentation - barely. To be honest, I did not sleep enough, so I was slower and sleepy. I think I worked just about 45-60 minutes today. But I will make up for it by working after maturita.

During this time I was having a discussion with the school department of IT of possible implementation of this website online and replacing the current school website. It went well. It was more or less a discussion or plan what to do next.

13.4.2023
We were creating our new presentation about the usage of Joomla, servers, and some other related terminology.
-Šimon&Tom

4.5.2023
We managed to take all information from the server and export it. + I was researching some things about the servers and stilled looked if the hosting is good (better to reasearch than be sorry), while Šimon was trying to learn about Joomla on my PC. For backup we used the Akeeba Backup plugin.
-Tom

While I had only chance to learn Joomla from videos, Tomáš game me his computer so I can actually have some actual practise. + I helped him to export the website.
-Šimon (sent via Discort to Tom)

11.5.2023 + Weekend
I continued to learn about Joomla, from videos again. + I told Tomáš that I will help him with implementation of things this weekend.
-Šimon (sent via Discort to Tom)

I started the whole migration to the actual website. I hope I will complete it during this weekend because I was in the hospital.
-Tom

14.5.2023
Here we go. We managed to upload the webiste and made it live on https://bilgym-sk.azurewebsites.net/index.php; We changed the hosting because it was not that controllable as we thought it would be. We used the Microsoft Azure Portal: Web App and we hosted the Azure Database for MySQL flexible server and Web app. It is getting paid from Student Azure Credits.
NOTE: If the website is not showing, it is because it is either down (to reduce the usage of resources) or undergoing maintenance/upgrades. Please try again later or contact Tommy via Edupage, GitHub, or other social media. - This will be available until the 12.6.2023.
