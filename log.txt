Finding a suitable hosting for our Joomla website, so we can share it with the teacher. But to be honest, I haven't done much, I scrolled through the internet for hosting and then made documentation for this project. This is the most probable hosting we will use: https://www.awardspace.com/free-hosting/

By the end of February
I have finished the translation of the website pages into Slovak.

Ok, I continued in finding a new hosting for our Joomla website, so I will proceed to transfer the page there after the maturita. + I looked at the 2 language system - but for only a few minutes.

We had a discussion with Simon what we can add to the webiste to even more improve its functions. For now, we decided we would add a plugin which will autotranslate new articles to Slovak or English: https://www.automatic-translation.online/installation; When the webiste will be in both languages, we will try to implement this plugin. If it would not work, then we will create a new one or find another. Otherwise we were discussing a lot about the upcomming plans for website, but have not decided for anything else than it is now.
