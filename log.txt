Tom made the plan for 180 mins. After that, he looked how we should do the second language website variation.

I continued with the translations for the Slovak version of the site and tried to come up with the different messages for the homepage slider.

Finding a suitable hosting for our Joomla website, so we can share it with the teacher. But to be honest, I haven't done much, I scrolled through the internet for hosting and then made documentation for this project. This is the most probable hosting we will use: https://www.awardspace.com/free-hosting/

By the end of February
I have finished the translation of the website pages into Slovak.

Ok, I continued in finding a new hosting for our Joomla website, so I will proceed to transfer the page there after the maturita. + I looked at the 2 language system - but for only a few minutes.

I was creating text for the slider on the homepage

We had a discussion with Simon about what we can add to the website, even more, improve its functions. For now, we decided we would add a plugin that will auto-translate new articles to Slovak or English: https://www.automatic-translation.online/installation; When the website is in both languages, we will try to implement this plugin. If it does not work, we will create a new one or find another. Otherwise, we were discussing a lot about the upcoming plans for the website but have not decided on anything else than it is now.

I studied enough and so I looked right inside the Joomla and tested the bilingual website on my testing website. I just managed to start it but did not actually add the add-on for translation. Just wanted to make sure some functions work. Otherwise, we started to work on the presentation - barely. To be honest, I did not sleep enough, so I was slower and sleepy. I think I worked just about 45-60 minutes today. But I will make up for it by working after maturita.
